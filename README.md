# Basic Flask CRUD

## Description

This repository contains a CRUD made in flask, very simple to start with any project in which you need a crud.

## Usage

### Installing 

In order to install the crud first we open our cmd (or gitbash) by pressing `Windows + r` and tapping cmd then pressing `Enter`
It will open a console in which you must enter the following commands....
First we open any console that we want to use | and we go to our desktop.
In my case is like this, C:\Users\emily\OneDrive\Desktop>


- ``` cd <your_desktop> ``` 
- ``` git clone https://github.com/emily883/Flask_CRUD.git ```
- ``` cd Flask_CRUD ```

Then you install the requirements creating a new env (recommended, I use conda)

- ``` conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt ```

Do not forget to activate the env with ``` conda activate <env> ```


## RUN IT

Once you are inside ``` Flask_CRUD ``` you can run the command ``` python app.py ``` The server is running so you can see it running at the address shown in the console
